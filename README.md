This development version of pySAS can be used with versions 20 and up of XMM-Newton SAS.

This repository can be cloned by going into the directory where pySAS is installed (i.e. /path/to/sas/install/xmmsas_202XXXXXX_YYYY/lib/python), remove the current version of pySAS (rm -rf ./pysas) and then clone this version of pySAS by executing the command

git clone https://github.com/rjtanner/pysas

You can then use pySAS like normal.
